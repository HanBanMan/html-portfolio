<h2>Personal</h2>
<p>
  My name is Hannah Phelps. I have 2 children, Alayna who is currently a year
  and a half and James (I've nicknamed him Jimothy after my husband and I's
  favorite show, <em>The Office</em>) who is 2 months old. My husband, James, is
  my soulmate, I will be forever greatful that our paths crossed when they did.
  Finally, I also have two dogs, Arya my Husky and Shadow my Boonie dog. Boonie
  is a term in Guam that just means he's a mix of different breeds. I am
  separating from the U.S. Navy on 24AUG23 and moving to Oklahoma with my
  husband due to him staying in the Navy. I enjoy riding my motorcycle, reading
  and audiobooks, being creative and active, coding, driving boats, learning new
  things, working out, and crocheting.

<h2>Professional</h2>
<p>
  I always said I've been working since I was 5 because I would help cook, take
  orders, and serve food at a Skeet club my grandpa was the president of, but
  I'm sure I can't put that on a resume, haha! My legitimate work history
  started at the Little Ceasars in Franklin, PA, when i was 15 but I always had
  2 or 3 jobs at a time. I would mainly help my friend and cater weddings around
  western Pennsylvania. Then I started my job at a new local diner called Three
  Squared (which didn't last long). After waitressing at the diner I moved over
  to working at a Campground called VacationLand. At the campground I worked at
  the Snack Shak and made food, created ice cream dishes, and worked the
  register. Finally I graduated Highschool and started working at the Main
  Street Market in Polk, PA. These people became family. I will always cherish
  the time I spent with them and I always make sure to visit when I'm home. My
  time was, however, cut short when I left to join the U.S. Navy in December of
  2016. After Boot camp I went to my job specific schooling which is called "A"
  School, in San Antonio, TX. After A School I was assigned my first duty
  station, Naval Weapons Station Yorktown. In Yorktown I had the privilage to go
  from a crewmember all the way to a Harbor Security Boat Coxswain. After
  Yorktown I was assigned to Naval Base Guam where I started as a Coxswain.
  However, a little over a year I got pregnant with my first born so I could not
  perform my primary job anymore. I then became a Shore Installation Basic Boat
  Coxswain Trainer, Departmental Career Counselor, Harbor Maintenance Readiness
  Coordinator, and Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Unit and Victim
  Advocate. Now I will be getting out of the Navy in a few short days and then I
  look to become a software engineer. Fingers Crossed!!

<h2>Education</h2>
<p>
  My education isn't anything to write home about... YET. I graduated from
  Lakeview High School in Stoneboro, PA. I then went for my Associated degree in
  Counter Terrorism through American Military University while I started my
  Naval career. Now I am currently pursuing a Software Engineering Bachelors degree
  through Western Governors University. I look forward to learning more and to
  see what the future holds.
