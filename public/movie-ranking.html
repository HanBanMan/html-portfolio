<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Harry Potter Series</h3>
<p>I mean I was born in 1997 what else do you want from me?</p>

<h3>Hunger Games Trilogy</h3>
<p>I read the books a million times as a kid and it was really cool seeing a woman be the main character and such a bad ass while also going through a lot emotionaly and physically.</p>

<h3>Totoro</h3>
<p>You would get it if you've seen it. If you haven't what are you waiting for?</p>
